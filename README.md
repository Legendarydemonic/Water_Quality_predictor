# Water_Quality_predictor
An ML insight on predicting water quality for drinking by comparing with multiple ML Classification models

Using popular and powerful python libraries i have deduced the best Machine Learning model to give the correct predection with the highest accuracy.

## Set-up

Download the dataset.csv file which has all the recorded data we use.
Download the Water_Quality_MI_Project.ipynb into jupyter notebook
Run all the commands
If you dont have any depenencies "pyton -m pip install \library_name\"

## Libraries 

```bash
1. pandas
2. sklearn
3. numpy
4. matplotlib
5. seaborn
```
**numpy**: is used to consume the data provided in efficient and managable manner
**pandas**: is too used for bulk data analysis and manipulation.
**matplotlib ,seaborn**: are used to graphically and visually represenr data.
**sklearn**: is used for importing pre trained model and processing of data.

## Models

```bash
DECISION TREE
RANDOM FOREST
LOGISTIC REGRESSION
KNN
SVM
```

**After drawing this conclusion i used svm as the model to predict if the water was drinkable or no**
